Haskell course homework

### How to pass the course

- homework
    - after each lecture | **10 points max**
    - deadline: Thursday 23:59 | **0 points per task after the deadline**
    - 1 week to fix my comments | **all comments fixed -> full grade**.
    - write tests | **no tests -> your grade goes down**
    - project can be built and tests work | **build/tests fail to my review -> -2 points**
        - write me before opening PR if you can't solve the problem
    - use `hlint` and `Wall` | **not explained compiler warnings and hlint recomnnedations -> -1 point**
    - do not pass solutions to each other | **explicit reuse -> 0 points per task**
        - write me before opening PR if you struggle with the task and want to get a hint
    - Once a semester, you may pass homework after the deadline (no more than 1 week later) and get a full grade
- exam
    - theory + practice
- [grade for the course] = [average homework grade] * 0.5 + [exam] * 0.5
